# Hunyuan-Multi-Lora-Loader
A custom node to make loading multiple lora's easier in the 2 main ways to run Hunyuan in ComfyUI

Kijai's amazing Hunyuan Wrapper node just bugged me with the way lora's have to be chained, so I made this to make it a little cleaner and better organized. It also works on the native comfy workflows. If you use multiple lora's, just set them to double blocks and so far in my testing it's worked pretty well.
